# Pig Latin
Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing. It obeys a few simple rules (below), but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.

Rule 1: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
Rule 2: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
There are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional variants too.

If English isn't your primary language, Pig Latin may seem tricky. For a complete discussion of Pig Latin, see this Wikipedia article. You can also watch the solution video from about the 3:30 point through about 10:30 without having the solution spoiled for you.
