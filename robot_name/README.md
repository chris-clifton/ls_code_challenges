# ROBOT NAME

Write a program that manages robot factory settings.

When Robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.  The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while, we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means their name gets wiped.  The next time you ask, it will respond with a new random name.

The names must be random, they should now follow a predictable sequence.  Random names means a risk of collisions.  Solution should not allow the use of the same name twice when avoidable.
